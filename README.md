## About this project
Project Mewo is a collection of my do-it-yourself "side quests". It contains all of my public projects, designs, works and so on.

I've always wanted to make an archive for this kind of thing, but I decided to also learn web development and frontend design by writing a website for it.

This, in particular, is an attempt to make a modern landing page. This project uses:
- [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/)
- [React 18](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

For now, there is no project listing yet. Just the landing page.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ProjectMewo/Landing.git
